##Bingo Game

#####I think the game played in Turkey is a little different from the one played in Europe. You'll notice as you read the instructions below.

=> Bingo is a game of chance played over 3 sets with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5 players.
=> Unique (different from each other) and random in the range of 1 (inclusive) - 90 (inclusive) in the bingo game
Cards with 15 integers are used. There are 10 of these cards in total and are included in the game.
Each player with a choice randomly chooses one of these cards at the start of the game
=> Stamps with consecutive integers in the range of 1 (inclusive) - 90 (inclusive) in each set of the game
A bag is used. A checker is drawn at a random time from this bag, and each player speaks.
The subject checks whether the number on the stamp exists on his own bingo card. This process
The game continues in a similar way until the set is complete.
=>The player who draws 5 numbers from the bag on his card, the first zinc, the player who draws 10 numbers from the bag.
The player who has drawn the second zinc and all the numbers on his card is considered to have made a bingo.
=> The player who makes the first zinc 5 points, the player who makes the second zinc 10 points, and the player who makes the bingo
gains 15 points
=> When any player makes a bingo, the respective game set is over. At the start of a new set, each
The player randomly chooses a new card from among 10 cards and all the checkers are placed in the bag.
is returned to
=>The player with the highest score after 3 sets of games wins the game.
